The quality issues that I encounterede with were:
1. Some entries were missing, some fields had no entry at all in some cases.
2. Some entres had inverted commas (strings) and had commas within them which caused problems.
3. Some entries had multiple spelling mistakes. Like Yellow and yallow
4. some entries used different ways of mentioning the same object (like bmw and bmwA3). It is the same model but different people mentin it differently.
5. Some entries had wrong inputs(not possible). Like 99 in registration_state
